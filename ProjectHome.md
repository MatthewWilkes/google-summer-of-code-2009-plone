<p>The Plone Foundation exists to promote Plone, an open source Content Management System based on Zope 2.  Plone has existed for almost 10 years, and was started by Alexander Limi, Alan Runyan and Vidar Andersen.  The community has had an annual conference since 2003 which has taken place in New Orleans, Vienna (twice), Seattle, Naples and Washington DC.  Over 350 people are expected at the next conference in Budapest.  Over 300 companies specialise in Plone development and users include NASA, the CIA, the Brazillian Government, Akamai and Oxfam.</p>
